				<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				<h2>Myers-Briggs Test Results – <i>ISTP-T</i></h1>
					<p>“A Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with
						inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.” (16Personalities, 2020)</p>
					<h2> Leadership Style – <i>Contrarian Leader</i></h2>
					<p>“You’ve been liberated from binary thinking, rarely jumping to either/or solutions. Contrarian leaders can hold conflicting ideas and perspectives in their minds for long periods of time. You never blindly trust experts and defer
						decision making if it is reasonable to wait. You may even delegate the decision to a subordinate. Selling yourself and your vision to followers helps you gain buy in from followers and get their input as well. Contrarian leaders know they
						only spent a fraction of their time moving forward an important agenda, this is the nature of the job. However, you know how to make that time count by following a counter-intuitive and challenging path.” (University of Southern
						California, 2020)</p>
					<h2> Big 5 personality test – <i>Empathic Idealist</i></h2>
					<p>“You have a highly creative and imaginative way of thinking and you often see connections that others do not. You are uninterested in the dull facts of a situation, preferring instead to interpret its meaning and implications. You have
						unusual ideas and sometimes perceive things that other people are not aware of. You are easily absorbed by fantasy and enjoy envisioning alternate realities as well as possibilities for the future.</p>
					<p>You tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the needs and experiences of others. As a highly empathetic person, you feel others’ emotions almost as strongly as your own, and as such, the experiences of others occupy an important place
						in your mind. Your thoughts often revolve around how you might be more helpful to others, or how you can better understand what they are going through.” (Truity, 2020)</p>
					<h2>What these results mean for me</h2>
					<p>The Myers Briggs Personality Test has confirmed my introverted bias and my often-sparse communication style. I’m pleased to learn about positive traits such as good prioritisation skills, relaxed attitude and natural ability in a crisis.
						It has also highlighted my tendency to be stubborn and direct in my communication which can be misinterpreted as being insensitive.</p>
					<p>The leadership stye test has confirmed my bias away from black and white thinking and my tendency to embrace the grey areas. We all see the world through our own lens that shapes our personal perspectives, which while different can both
						be true and correct.</p>
					<p>The Big Five Personality Test describes my personality pattern as being an Empathetic Idealist and an Analytical Thinker which I would identify with. Empathetic Idealists are described as “Uses insight and creativity to help others.
						Thinks about how the world could be a better and more beautiful place.” (The Big Five Personality Test, 2020) which I believe fits in well with the Information Technology profession.
					<p>
					<h2>How I think these results could influence my behaviour in a team</h2>
					<p>I will be able to bring a range of positive traits to a team such as being optimistic, creative and practical, rational, know how to prioritize, calm under pressure and a relaxed attitude. I would hope these traits would allow me to successfully manage and mitigate conflict within a team environment with a calming influence on the team.</p>
					<p>Teammates could easily interpret my direct and often sparse communication style as being insensitive which could quickly lead to friction within the group. To counter this, I will need to make a conscious effort around my communication style.</p>
					<h2>How I could take these results into account when forming a team</h2>
				<p>	These results won’t affect my choices when forming a team as workplace teams are comprised of people with various sorts of backgrounds and personalities and often cannot be chosen by employees themselves. Instead I will focus on how I can understand my teammates and change my behaviour accordingly to produce positive outcomes for the team.<p>
