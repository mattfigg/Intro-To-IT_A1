				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
				<p>One of the aspects that drew me to IT as a career was the predicted strong future industry stability and growth. Studying IT also allows me to round out my existing Graphic Design skills and experience should I choose to move into a full
					stack web development roll.
				<h3>When my interest in IT started </h3>
				<p>I have had an interest in technology from a very young age as I’ve been fortunate enough to have seen the introduction and integration of the internet into everyday life. At an adult I’ve seen how the internet has grown from a one way
					static communication tool into a dynamic hub for information gathering, sharing and distribution. As technology develops it is becoming further intertwined in our everyday lives from IoT to big data.</p>
				<h3>What sparked my interest in IT </h3>
				<p>I have memories of setting up dial-up internet connections in the early 1990’s, which at the time felt like I was programming an amazing piece of work. Those early experiences with computers and the internet that sparked my interest in
					technology.</p>
				<h3>My IT experience</h3>
				One of my first jobs was at a computer rental business that specialised in renting computers to corporate clients and provided setups for conferences. My role was decidedly entry level and I would be responsible for imaging machines and
				running network cables for conference instillation. While I would describe myself as a digital native, I would not claim to have any previous professional IT experience that would benefit my current career aspirations.</p>
				<h2>Why I choose to study to RMIT</h2>
				<p>One of the deciding factors that led me to study at RMIT was the online first approach of the Bachelor of Information Technology run through Open Universities. Studying online allows me the flexibility to study when and where I can and to
					fit study around existing commitments. A program the was specifically designed as an online course was more attractive than a traditional in person course that had been modified to an online curriculum.</p>
				<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
				<p>I expect to gain broad foundational knowledge of the IT industry while studying at RMIT which will allow me to further specialise in specific skills required depending on my chosen career path. I am most interested in the software/web
					development aspects of the degree and at this stage I intend to complete the minor in Internet Design which I hope will equip me with front end coding knowledge. </p>
