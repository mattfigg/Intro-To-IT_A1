				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>The COVIDtrack System is a refinement and expansion of the Australian Governments COVIDsafe app that is currently available for iOS and Android mobile devices. COVIDtrack will expand on the current Australian Government solution by
					providing additional hardware devices that are dedicated and designed specifically for the COVIDtrack task.</p>
				<p>The system will provide features that both track close contacts in a similar manner to the current app but instead using a dedicated hardware solution as well as providing a solution for user visit registration and venue capacity tracking
					in businesses which is currently left to business to implement themselves.</p>
				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>The current COVIDsafe app has been received well it the Australian community with over 6.2 million people having downloaded the app in Australia (Bogle, 2020), Despite the relatively high numbers of downloads the app has room for
					improvement.</p>
				<h3>Current COVIDsafe issues:</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>App can easily be accidentally closed</li>
					<li>App causing Bluetooth connectivity issues particularly with iPhones</li>
					<li>No solution for digitally checking into a venue</li>
					<li>No solution for people (children) without smart phones</li>
					<li>No solution for situations where smartphone use may not be appropriate (sports)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One report suggests that the app only works 25% of the time (Taylor, 2020) and there have been reported issues with the app causing Bluetooth connectivity issues of essential medical devices on iPhones (Biggs, 2020). The rollout of the app
					rightly periodised speed of deployment and ease of implementation however with a possibility of no immediate cure for Covid-19 we should prepare longer term more reliable solutions to this challenge.</p>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The system will comprise of a mobile app & dongle for users and a tablet app for venues to use to check in patrons. Both the app and dongle can be used as a stand-alone products though the dongle will need to be registered and paired with
					the mobile phone app.</p>
				<p>Once paired the dongle will provide the user with a quicker and more reliable solution then the app. It will also allow family members who do not have a mobile device to participate in the program.</p>
				<p>Individuals who have tested positive for Covid or who should be quarantining will be flagged in the database, not allowing them to check into venues while they are contagious or should be isolating</p>
				<h3>User App Features</h3>
				<p>The primary function of the app will be to register details and to provide notifications to the user. Once installed and paired with the dongle users should only need to use the app to scan QR codes to check-in at venues should they choose
					not to use the dongle. If a dongle is detected the Bluetooth proximity function will be disables on the mobile device to conserve battery use and reduce possible Bluetooth conflicts with other apps on the device itself.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>iOS and Android compatible
					<li>Allows users to enter their contact details such as name, address and contact number which will be verified through SMS</li>
					<li>Family account allowing dependants without mobiles to use the dongle only</li>
					<li>Provides notifications when dongle battery needs charging</li>
					<li>Provides notifications to contact health department/contact tracers when suspected
						Covid contact has occurred</li>
					<li>Provides notifications of test results</li>
					<li>QR code reader for venue check-in</li>
					<li>Bluetooth proximity use automatically switches off when not needed </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>User Dongle Features</h3>
				<p>The User dongle will be designer to be weather resistant, have a long battery life and be easily portable for ease of use. When charged the dongle will always be on and actively seeking other units or mobile devices with the COVIDtrack
					installed and active.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>Will pair with mobile phone app</li>
					<li>Can be paired with parents or carers phone app</li>
					<li>NFC check-in system to allow quick, easy, private and secure venue check-in</li>
					<li>Always-on Bluetooth to detect and record other users in close proximity</li>
					<li>Charge indicator light to alert user when it needs charging</li>
					<li>Attachable to keychain or handbag</li>
					<li>Weather proof</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Venue Check-In App Features</h3>
				<p>The venue check-in app is designed to be used on a tablet that can be set up on a stand to greet customers as they enter a venue. On arrival users will have the option of either check in using touchless NFC or to scan a QR code using the
					COVIDtrack app on their mobile device. The check in app can also be used at testing facilities to increase user processing speed and to automatically notify the database that the user should be isolating until they receive the test results.
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>Dedicated check-in app for tablets</li>
					<li>NFC check-in system</li>
					<li>QR code check-in for app only users that do not have a dongle</li>
					<li>Always-on Bluetooth to detect and record other users in close proximity </li>
					(in case users have not checked in)</li>
					<li>Venue limits to prevent more users checking in then the venues capacity</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
				<p>The development of this project will require a code editor (Atom) to edit HTML, CSS and Java Script. A compiler (Eclipse) and relevant IDEs and plugins are required to develop Swift and Kotlin applications. Prototyping can be done using
					Figma, Sketch or Adobe XD and team collaboration with Microsoft Teams, word and Miro.</p>

				<h3>Software needed to develop project</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>Atom</li>
					<li>Eclipse</li>
					<li>Figma</li>
					<li>Git Hub</li>
					<li>Microsoft Teams</li>
					<li>Microsoft Word</li>
					<li>Miro </li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Hardware needed to develop project</h3>
				<li>IOS and Android mobile phones </li>
				<li>Raspberry Pi with NFC and Bluetooth addons</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Skills Required</h2>
				<h3>Software requirements</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>iOS and Android apps</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
						<li>iOS app development would require Swift (Apple, 2020).</li>
						<li>Android app can be written in Kotlin (Android, 2020).</li></ul>
					<li>Website</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
						<li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript (GeeksforGeeks, 2020)</li></ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Database
					<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>MySql, PHP, and Java Script (Spinx, 2020).</li></ul>
				</ol>

				<h3>Hardware requirements</h3>
				<p>To construct the hardware component of this project wouldn’t be feasible for this assignment though it could be prototyped using a Raspberry Pi with NFC and Bluetooth addons.</p>
				<h3>How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h3>
				<p>The hardware to prototype the project is easily sourced online at www.raspberrypi.org.</p>
				<p>While the skills to develop the entire project are easily accessible either directly through developer portals such as developer.android.com, developer.apple.com or through structured programs such as codecademy.com the time required to acquire all of the skills needed would be prohibitive.</p>
				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>If the project is successful and is adopted in large numbers by the Australian public, it will provide a large positive impact on the nation’s health and economic outcomes as economic recovery is strongly tied to lifting the restrictions on Australian businesses and residents. In the months after stage one restrictions were announced in Australia over 835,000 jobs were lost, by implementing an effective system to mitigate the ongoing risk of community transmission of COVID-19 we are paving the way to reopen the economy. </p>
				<p>The user dongle will solve the original problems of accidentally closing the app as the dongle will always be “on”, As it it’s a dedicated device there will be no Bluetooth connectivity clashes with other devices. It will be able to be carried with users into places where smartphones are not appropriate and will be able to be used by people that do not have smart phones allowing members of the public that would not have otherwise used the COVIDsafe app will now be able to participate in the tracking program which will provide </p>
				<p>The digital NFC check in system will improved privacy by eliminating handwritten registers of attendance which are visible to all business patrons. The system will also reduce check in time and improve data accuracy removing a hurdle to businesses.</p>
